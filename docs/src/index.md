# BaseModelica.jl: BaseModelica Importers for ModelingToolkit.jl

BaseModelica.jl is an interface for the SciML open source software organization for importing
BaseModelica, a new standard from the Modelica association for lowered Modelica code. As such,
it makes it easy to import Modelica models into ModelingToolkit.

## Installation

To install BaseModelica.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("BaseModelica")
```

## API

```@docs
parse_basemodelica
parse_experiment_annotation
create_odeproblem
experiment_settings
BaseModelica.UnsupportedFeatureError
```

## Constants and parameters

How declarations map to ModelingToolkit, and what `remake` can change afterwards:

| BaseModelica | ModelingToolkit | changeable after loading? |
|---|---|---|
| `constant Real c = 9.81` | inlined: every reference becomes `9.81` | no; `c` is not in the system |
| `parameter Real p = 2.0` | tunable parameter with initial value `2.0` | yes |
| `parameter Real r = p*q` | parameter with binding `r = p*q` | no; recomputed from `p` and `q` |
| `parameter Integer n = 3 annotation(Evaluate = true)` | non-tunable parameter | not reliably, see below |

- **Constants** are inlined. ModelingToolkit's `@constants` only marks a parameter
  `tunable = false`, which `remake` can still change; a Modelica constant cannot change.
  The value of a constant is not available as `prob.ps[c]`. A constant whose value is not
  a number (no binding, say) stays a non-tunable parameter.
- **Dependent bindings** become ModelingToolkit bindings, so
  `remake(prob; p = [sys.p => 5.0])` recomputes `r`, and so does every parameter bound to
  `r`. A bound parameter cannot be set itself: `remake(prob; p = [sys.r => 7.0])` throws.
  Bindings are listed by `ModelingToolkit.bound_parameters(sys)`, not by `parameters(sys)`.
- **`Evaluate = true` parameters** were evaluated by the tool that wrote the file, which may
  have used their value to size an array, unroll a `for` loop, pick an `if` branch or remove
  a conditional component. They become parameters with `tunable = false`, and a binding
  such as `k = 2*n` is evaluated to a number. Their description reads
  `parameter 'n' was evaluated at translation (Evaluate=true); recompile to change it`.
  ModelingToolkit has no metadata that makes `remake` or `setp` reject a parameter, so
  changing one is not an error; loading such a model warns once, listing them. Change the
  value in the Modelica source and translate again instead.
- **Inert parameters**, which no equation, binding, start value or other attribute
  references, were most likely used at translation by a tool that did not mark them
  `Evaluate = true`. Loading the model warns once, listing them: changing them has no
  effect.

## Booleans, events and the solver

- **Booleans defined by an equation**, such as `off = s < 0` or the hysteresis
  `y = pre(y) and u < a or u < b`, hold their value between events, as relations do in
  Modelica. Each is a discrete parameter holding 0 or 1 (equations see `off > 0.5`), so
  `sol.ps[sys.off]` reads 0.0 or 1.0. It is solved during initialization together with the
  unknowns it depends on, instead of keeping a `start` value that contradicts its
  definition, and `remake` with new initial values solves it again. Every relation of a
  definition that varies continuously gets a zero-crossing event, after which the Booleans
  are re-evaluated until none changes. They are also re-evaluated after any step at which
  one disagrees with its definition, which catches relations that jump at another event
  (`reinit`, `when` assignments).
- **Time events**: the instants at which an if-condition comparing `time` with a number or
  an expression of parameters switches (`if time < startTime then ...`) are stored as
  `tstops` on the system. ModelingToolkit passes them to every problem built from it, so
  the solver stops there instead of stepping over the discontinuity, and they follow
  parameter changes.
- **Models without differential states**: error control does not limit the step size, so
  a single step can span the whole simulation. `create_odeproblem` sets `dtmax` to the
  experiment `Interval` (or a 500th of the time span) for such models, so that events
  between steps are found; when building the problem yourself, pass `dtmax`. Reading
  `sol(t; idxs = ...)` is exact between steps, while `sol[var]` only holds the saved
  points (`saveat` is the `Interval`).
- **`assert` in an `initial algorithm`** is checked once the model is initialized, with the
  current parameters and initial values: a failed assertion throws from `solve` (level
  `AssertionLevel.warning`: logs a warning). One that can never hold is rejected when the
  model is loaded. `assert` in equations is not checked.
- **Threads**: conversions are serialized by a lock, so `parse_basemodelica` can be called
  from several tasks. The `:antlr` parser calls Python and only runs on the main thread;
  use `parser = :julia` elsewhere.

## Discrete backends

How discrete variables and `when` equations are lowered is pluggable. BaseModelica
evaluates them into a symbolic [`BaseModelica.DiscreteModel`](@ref) and passes it to a
backend. The built-in backend, `:mtk`, uses ModelingToolkit symbolic events. Other packages
provide backends by subtyping [`BaseModelica.AbstractDiscreteBackend`](@ref) and calling
[`BaseModelica.register_discrete_backend!`](@ref) from `__init__`. For example,
SynchToolkit.jl registers `:synchtoolkit` from its `SynchToolkitBaseModelicaExt` extension,
so `discrete_backend = :synchtoolkit` works after `using SynchToolkit`.
