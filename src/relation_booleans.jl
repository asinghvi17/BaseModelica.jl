# Boolean variables defined by an equation, such as `off = s < 0` (the ideal diodes and
# switches of the MSL) or `y = pre(y) and u < a or u < b` (hysteresis).
#
# In Modelica a relation keeps its value while the solver integrates and changes only at
# events. At initialization and at every event the Booleans are solved together with the
# continuous part of the model (event iteration). The lowering:
#
# - Each Boolean `b` is a Real discrete parameter holding 0 or 1, and equations see
#   `b > 0.5`: ModelingToolkit cannot solve for a Bool parameter during initialization.
# - Initialization: `b => missing` with the initialization equation
#   `b ~ ifelse(definition, 1, 0)`, in which `pre(b)` is the start value of `b`. The
#   initialization solve finds the Booleans together with the unknowns they depend on, so
#   `b` does not keep a `start` value that contradicts its definition.
# - Events: every relation of a definition that depends on a continuous variable gets a
#   continuous callback on its zero-crossing. At the root the relation may evaluate either
#   way, so the direction of the crossing gives its new value. The callback then
#   re-evaluates every Boolean until none changes (`pre(b)` being the value of the previous
#   iteration).
# - A discrete callback, checked after every step, re-evaluates the Booleans when one of
#   them disagrees with its definition. That happens when a relation jumps at another event
#   (`reinit`, a `when` assignment) instead of crossing zero. A relation within
#   `ROOT_TOLERANCE` of its root is undetermined there, and the Booleans that depend on it
#   keep their value.
#
# The callbacks use the same root finding and reinitialization as the `when` callbacks of
# the `:mtk` backend: ModelingToolkit then compiles them into one vector callback, which
# fires every callback whose root is at the same instant. Separate callbacks with a common
# root, as in `when u > 0.5` and `b = u > 0.5`, would lose one of the two events.
